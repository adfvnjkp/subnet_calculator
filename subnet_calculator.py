"""
Usage guideline:
run this file(subnet_calculator.py).
Enter an ip address and a number of subnets
This program will check if the input is valid. If not, this program will raise error.
If the input is valid, this program will print out the following:
The current network, mask, range of addresses and a possible high and low router address.
The number of bits needed to be stolen
The new subnet mask in binary and base 10 numbers.
The number of subnets created
The total number of hosts per subnet
The subnet range for the first 5 subnets or the number of requested subnets in binary and decimal numbers
The subnet range for the last subnet â€“ in binary and decimal numbers
The range of usable addresses in each
Possible low and high router addresses for each subnet
Identify the network IDs and the broadcast address
